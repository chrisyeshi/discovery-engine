Although both factors have been considered in modeling, existing works make strong assumptions about spatial dependence and temporal dynamics, i.e., spatial dependence is stationary in time, and temporal dynamics is strictly periodical. However, in practice, the spatial dependence could be dynamic (i.e., changing from time to time), and the temporal dynamics could have some perturbation from one period to another period.

Beyond merely predicting the occurrence of future events, practitioners are now looking for information about specific subtypes of future events in order to allocate appropriate amounts and types of resources to manage such events and any associated social risks. However, forecasting event subtypes is far more complex than merely extending binary prediction to cover multiple classes, as 1) different locations require different models to handle their characteristic event subtype patterns due to spatial heterogeneity; 2) historically, many locations have only experienced a incomplete set of event subtypes, thus limiting the local model\'s ability to predict previously "unseen" subtypes; and 3) the subtle discrepancy among different event subtypes requires more discriminative and profound representations of societal events. In order to address all these challenges concurrently, we propose a Spatial Incomplete Multi-task Deep leArning (SIMDA) framework that is capable of effectively forecasting the subtypes of future events. The new framework formulates spatial locations into tasks to handle spatial heterogeneity in event subtypes, and learns a joint deep representation of subtypes across tasks.

We propose a Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network (DMVST-Net) framework to model both spatial and temporal relations. Specifically, our proposed model consists of three views: temporal view (modeling correlations between future demand values with near time points via LSTM), spatial view (modeling local spatial correlation via local CNN), and semantic view (modeling correlations among regions sharing similar temporal patterns). Experiments on large-scale real taxi demand data demonstrate effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.",year:2018,authors:[{surname:"Yao",given:"Huaxiu"},{surname:"Wu",given:"Fei"},{surname:"Ke",given:"Jintao"},{surname:"Tang",given:"Xianfeng"},{surname:"Jia",given:"Yitian"},{surname:"Lu",given:"Siyu"},{surname:"Gong",given:"Pinghua"},{surname:"Ye",given:"Jiandong"},{surname:"Li",given:"Zhenhui"}],venue:{name:"AAAI"},nReferences:20,nCitedBys:52},{artId:"zhang-2016-7687d0d64ce7dac8",type:"paper",title:"Deep Spatio-Temporal Residual Networks for Citywide Crowd Flows Prediction",abstract:"Forecasting the flow of crowds is of great importance to traffic management and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as inter-region traffic, events, and weather.

We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic. For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region.

We show that deep learning architectures can capture these nonlinear spatio-temporal effects.

However, the potential of deep learning methods in traffic forecasting has not yet fully been exploited in terms of the depth of the model architecture, the spatial scale of the prediction area, and the predictive power of spatial-temporal data. In this paper, a deep stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM (SBU- LSTM) neural network architecture is proposed, which considers both forward and backward dependencies in time series data, to predict network-wide traffic speed. A bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) layer is exploited to capture spatial features and bidirectional temporal dependencies from historical data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that BDLSTMs have been applied as building blocks for a deep architecture model to measure the backward dependency of traffic data for prediction. The proposed model can handle missing values in input data by using a masking mechanism. Further, this scalable model can predict traffic speed for both freeway and complex urban traffic networks.

In this paper, we propose a Latent Space Model for Road Networks (LSM-RN) to address these challenges. In particular, given a series of road network snapshots, we learn the attributes of vertices in latent spaces which capture both topological and temporal properties. As these latent attributes are time-dependent, they can estimate how traffic patterns form and evolve. In addition, we present an incremental online algorithm which sequentially and adaptively learn the latent attributes from the temporal graph changes. Our framework enables real-time traffic prediction by 1) exploiting real-time sensor readings to adjust/update the existing latent spaces, and 2) training as data arrives and making predictions on-the-fly with given data.

Understanding how different air pollutants accumulate and propagate is critical to making relevant public policies. In this paper, we use urban big data (air quality data and meteorological data) to identify the spatiotemporal (ST) causal pathways for air pollutants. This problem is challenging because: (1) there are numerous noisy and low-pollution periods in the raw air quality data, which may lead to unreliable causality analysis; (2) for large-scale data in the ST space, the computational complexity of constructing a causal structure is very high; and (3) the ST causal pathways are complex due to the interactions of multiple pollutants and the influence of environmental factors. Therefore, we present pgCausality, a novel pattern-aided graphical causality analysis approach that combines the strengths of pattern mining and Bayesian learning to efficiently identify the ST causal pathways. First, pattern mining helps suppress the noise by capturing frequent evolving patterns (FEPs) of each monitoring sensor, and greatly reduce the complexity by selecting the pattern-matched sensors as "causers". Then, Bayesian learning carefully encodes the local and ST causal relations with a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN)-based graphical model, which also integrates environmental influences to minimize biases in the final results. We evaluate our approach with three real-world data sets containing 982 air quality sensors in 128 cities, in three regions of China from 01-Jun-2013 to 31-Dec-2016.

In the meantime, we have a rich set of urban data in NYC including points-of-interest (POIs), geo-tagged tweets, weather, vehicle collisions, etc. Is it possible that these ubiquitous datasets can be used to explain the city traffic? Understanding the hidden correlation between external data and traffic data would allow us to answer many important questions in urban computing such as: If we observe a high traffic volume at Madison Square Garden (MSG) in NYC, is it because of the regular peak hour or a big event being held at MSG? If a disaster weather such as a hurricane or a snow storm hits the city, how would the traffic be affected? While existing studies may utilize external datasets for prediction task, they do not explicitly seek for direct explanations from the external datasets. In this paper, we present our results in attempts to understand taxi traffic dynamics in NYC from multiple external data sources. We use four real-world ubiquitous urban datasets, including POI, weather, geo-tagged tweet, and collision records. To address the heterogeneity of ubiquitous urban data, we present carefully-designed feature representations for various datasets.
